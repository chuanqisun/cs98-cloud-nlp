In fact, the very question of &ldquo;what is agene?&rdquo; is even being reconsidered, as the fundamental unit of genomicorganization appears not to be the classical DNA-based &ldquo;gene&rdquo; butinstead is the RNA-based transcript.  In this course we will explore theseissues and more through lectures, literature discussions, student-ledpresentations, and student writing assignments. ',"instructor": 'Peterson',"distribution": 'SCI',"offered": '15S, 16S: 12'},

Thefirst part of this course covers this historical emergence of middle easternregimes since the early 1950s.In each country--Libya, Tunisia,Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Morocco, Algeria--eliteshave responded differently to the uprising, depending in part on theinstitutional repertoire each country possessed. As yet, it is unclear what thedifferent trajectories of each country\'s period of upheaval will be, but theyall share important common political elements and developments: transitionalarrangements as the first phase of contestation comes to an end, proposedelections leading to constitution-making processes and to referendums that aremeant to introduce--or re-introduce--forms of constitutional government.In order to understand this protracted process we will study the mechanics oftransition through a comparative case-study approach in particularly Libya,Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, and Bahrain. Peripherally we also study the question ofwhy the Arab Gulf states have been relatively immune from popular uprisings,and we incorporate in our discussion as well the role international actors (theUnited Nations, the Arab League, the African Union, the European Union) haveplayed in the unfolding of the uprisings and beyond.',"instructor": 'Vandewalle',"distribution": 'Dist: INT or SOC; WCult: NW',"offered": '15W: 2A'},
